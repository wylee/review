# Review - A simple GitHub code review tool

Given a GitHub repository, classify its open pull requests as containing
interesting items or not and display a report with this information.

Run it on the command line like this:

    review owner/repo

The output will look something like this:

    https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/mmm - Interesting
    https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/nnn - Not Interesting
